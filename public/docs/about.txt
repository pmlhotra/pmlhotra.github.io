Hi, I'm Pankaj Malhotra. I currently work as a <strong>Software Development Manager</strong> at <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>. I'm primarily based in <strong>Cape Town</strong>, a stunning coastal city in South Africa—also the birthplace of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gk_I_0eMDA" target="_blank">EC2 and AWS</a>.<br/><br/>

My work involves leveraging <strong>AWS-managed services</strong> to build serverless systems with globally distributed service stacks operating in <em>multi-master mode</em> across multiple regions. The challenge lies in ensuring these stacks run independently yet in parallel, delivering high availability and fault tolerance.<br/><br/>

Before joining AWS, I was part of the Infrastructure team at <a href="https://www.browserstack.com" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a> in Mumbai, India, where I contributed to developing and managing cross-region datacenter services to ensure high uptime and reliability. So, if you’ve ever used a mobile device on BrowserStack, there’s a good chance it’s running some of my code.<br/><br/>

I’m passionate about <strong>Web Services</strong>, <strong>Distributed Systems</strong>, and <strong>Automation</strong>, with more than three years of experience in Python and a growing focus on Java. I've also <a href="/public/docs/MozillaAlumniCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">participated</a> in initiatives to keep the Web open.<br/><br/>

Notably, I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code Intern</a> and had the opportunity to <a href="https://goo.gl/7bXgNb" target="_blank">work</a> with some amazing engineers at Mozilla Corporation. I also explored Infrastructure Orchestration and DevOps while <a href="https://pankajmalhotra.com/Infrastructure-Automation-Using-Terraform-Packer-Consul-Atlas" target="_blank">working as a Spring Scholar</a> at <a href="https://hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>.<br/><br/>
